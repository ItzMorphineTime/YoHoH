# The Shattered Seas — World Lore & Backstory

> *"The old empires drowned. The seas broke. Five crowns rose from the wreckage—and none of them bow to any king on land."*

## The World: The Shattered Seas

The **Shattered Seas** are what remains of a once-unified ocean realm. Centuries ago, a cataclysm—some say a war between gods, others a volcanic chain reaction, still others whisper of something that *woke* beneath the waves—shattered the continental shelves and drowned the great coastal empires. What survived was an archipelago of scattered islands, treacherous straits, and waters that no longer obey the old charts.

Today, the seas are ruled by **trade, rumor, and fear**. The inner archipelago—the **Home Waters**—remains relatively safe: established ports, merchant guilds, and the last vestiges of naval authority. But beyond the safe routes lie the **Outer Seas**, where the **Five Pirate Kings** hold dominion. Each King commands a domain shaped by their curse, their ambition, or their obsession. Sailors who venture too far may never return—or return changed.

## Dragons: The Last of the Great Beasts

**Dragons** once ruled the skies and volcanic isles of the Shattered Seas—ancient, proud, and few. The cataclysm that drowned the empires also scattered their nesting grounds and drove them to the edges of the world. Now they are **nearly extinct**, hunted to the brink by those who covet their power.

### Why the Kings Hunt Dragons

- **Dragon eggs** hatch loyal beasts that can burn fleets and dominate the seas.  
- **Dragon scales and bone** fuel ancient magic, curses, and artifacts.  
- **A living dragon** is the ultimate symbol of dominance—or the ultimate rival to eliminate.

Most of the **Five Pirate Kings** hunt dragons relentlessly. They raid volcanic islands for eggs, ambush migrating dragons at sea, and pay bounties for any captain who delivers a dragon—dead or alive—to their strongholds. The few dragons that remain are scattered, hidden, or captured.

### Your Mission: Rescue and Save the Dragons

You are not like the Kings. Your calling is to **rescue and save** the last of the great beasts—to find dragon eggs before hunters do, to free captured dragons from King strongholds, and to ferry them to **sanctuaries** where they can hatch and thrive in peace.

This puts you in **direct opposition** to most of the Pirate Kings. They will hunt you as fiercely as they hunt dragons—unless you outsmart them, outfight them, or find unlikely allies among those who do not share their obsession.

### Dragon Sanctuaries

Hidden islands and secret coves serve as **dragon sanctuaries**—places where rescued eggs can hatch and young dragons can grow without fear. Building, protecting, and supplying these sanctuaries is a core part of your mission. Some say the Ghost Captain himself has been known to aid those who share this cause.

## The Five Pirate Kings

### 1. Jasper Barrow — The Ghost Captain of the Righteous Tide

**Theme:** Curse • Justice • Ghosts • Vengeance  
**Alignment:** Chaotic Good (Relentless, Unforgiving)  
**Status:** Undead (Revenant / Reborn)

**Backstory**  
Once the youngest son of a revered admiral, Jasper Barrow was raised on honor but denied the sea. When he finally earned his own command, he became a protector of the innocent rather than a conqueror. His downfall came when he uncovered his father's betrayal—selling naval secrets to pirate lords for gold.

Declared a traitor and disowned, Jasper was lured into a storm by a false distress call and sunk by his own blood. Death could not still his sense of justice. He rose as a Ghost Captain, bound to the sea until corruption is punished.

Now, Jasper hunts tyrants, pirate kings, corrupt rulers, and bullies—especially those who prey on weaker crews or islands.

**Dragons:** Jasper does **not** hunt dragons. He sees them as fellow victims of tyranny—hunted, betrayed, driven to the brink. He has been known to aid captains who rescue dragons and has even guided lost eggs to sanctuary. An unlikely ally in your mission.

**Familiar:** *Gloomfeather* — Spectral Parrot  
- Debuffs enemies (fear, misfortune, cursed rolls)  
- Scouts invisibly through fog and darkness  
- Mimics enemy voices to sow panic  

**Domain:** *The Veilwake Sea* — fog-choked waters where ghost ships drift silently  
- His ghost fleet can ignore blockades  
- Ports under his watch see reduced piracy… unless they're corrupt  

**Player Hooks**  
- Appears to aid bullied players mid-fight  
- May spare or reward honorable crews  
- Can become a powerful ally… or relentless enemy

### 2. Captain Mordekai Drakon — The Sea Serpent King

**Theme:** Curse • Serpents • Ancient Magic  
**Alignment:** Lawful Evil  

**Backstory**  
Mordekai was once a cabin boy aboard a doomed merchant vessel. When the ship was attacked by a colossal sea serpent, he discovered an ancient blade sealed within the hold. Slaying the beast bound its dying spirit to him.

Over time, the serpent's curse twisted Mordekai—granting power, longevity, and dominion over the deep, but slowly replacing his humanity. He now rules through fear and inevitability, believing the seas demand dominance, not mercy.

**Dragons:** Mordekai **hunts dragons** relentlessly. Serpents and dragons are ancient rivals—both draconic, both claiming dominion over the deep. He consumes dragon scales and bone to feed Ssyrix and extend his own power. His lieutenants raid volcanic islands and ambush migrating dragons at sea.

**Familiar:** *Ssyrix* — The Bound Serpent Spirit  
- Wraps ships, immobilizing them  
- Inflicts stacking curses over time  
- Can briefly possess Mordekai to amplify power  

**Domain:** *The Coiled Expanse* — waters marked by massive serpentine shapes beneath the waves  
- Ships move slower  
- Crew morale drains over time  

**Player Hooks**  
- Hunts players who grow too powerful too quickly  
- May offer cursed power in exchange for loyalty  
- Slaying him risks releasing the serpent upon the world

### 3. Lady Adara Thalassa — Queen of the Leviathans

**Theme:** Atlantis • Leviathans • Ocean Sovereignty  
**Alignment:** Neutral (Ruthlessly Pragmatic)  

**Backstory**  
Adara was born to a sunken empire—one of the last true descendants of Atlantis. When her people fell beneath the waves, she reclaimed their legacy by stealing the **Trident of the Tides**, an artifact granting command over leviathans.

She does not raid for gold—she conquers to rebuild a lost civilization beneath the sea. Islands that swear fealty are protected. Those that resist are erased.

**Dragons:** Adara **hunts dragons** as obstacles to her ocean sovereignty. Dragons are ancient, powerful, and refuse to bow—they threaten her claim to rule the seas. She captures eggs for Atlantean rituals and slays adult dragons that encroach on her domain. Delivering a dragon egg to her stronghold earns rare favor—and damns the dragon.

**Familiar:** *Pearl* — Juvenile Leviathan  
- Shields allies with tidal barriers  
- Heals ships and structures  
- Grows stronger the longer Adara reigns  

**Domain:** *The Drowned Crown* — a semi-submerged kingdom of coral and ruins  
- Can flood islands  
- Controls trade routes via sea beasts  

**Player Hooks**  
- Can become a powerful political ally  
- Might task players with reclaiming Atlantean relics  
- Open war with her reshapes the map

### 4. Nimue Tideborn — The Kraken Caller

**Theme:** Darkness • Abyss • Madness  
**Alignment:** Chaotic Neutral  

**Backstory**  
Once a fisher's daughter obsessed with legends, Nimue discovered an abyssal song etched into black stone. Singing it summoned not death—but a young Kraken. Instead of fleeing, she bonded with it.

As the Kraken grew, so did Nimue's power—and her distance from humanity. She no longer raids ports; she drags entire fleets into the dark to "feed the deep."

**Dragons:** Nimue **hunts dragons** to feed the Kraken. Dragons are powerful prey—their essence sustains the deep and empowers her bond with the abyss. She sends her servants to lure dragons into the Black Spiral, where the Kraken drags them under. A dragon egg is a rare delicacy; a full-grown dragon, a feast.

**Familiar:** *Inkshadow* — Living Shadow Octopus  
- Creates zones of magical darkness  
- Blinds and disorients enemies  
- Can merge with the Kraken to empower it  

**Domain:** *The Black Spiral* — waters that absorb light and sound  
- Visibility is severely reduced  
- Sanity-testing environment  

**Player Hooks**  
- May ignore players entirely… until provoked  
- Can be reasoned with via ancient lore  
- Killing the Kraken may break her mind—or free her

### 5. Captain Ebon Flameheart — The Dragon Marauder

**Theme:** Fire • Dragons • Conquest  
**Alignment:** Chaotic Evil  

**Backstory**  
Ebon was once a subordinate pirate, hungry for more. During a raid on a volcanic isle, he stole a dragon egg and survived long enough to hatch it. That dragon—**Blackfang**—made him a legend.

Ebon believes strength is the only truth. He conquers islands not to rule them, but to burn them into submission, forging a fleet of fear and fire.

**Dragons:** Ebon **hunts dragons** to eliminate all rivals. He has Blackfang—the only dragon that matters. Every other dragon is a threat: another captain could hatch an egg, another King could claim a beast. He burns dragon nests, slaughters migrating dragons, and pays bounties for eggs delivered to him—so he can crush them himself. There will be only one Dragon King.

**Familiar:** *Ember* — Fire Phoenix  
- Revives after death  
- Ignites ships and crews  
- Buffs allies with flame-based rage  

**Domain:** *The Ashen Reach* — scorched islands and burning seas  
- Constant fire hazards  
- Volcanic events during combat  

**Player Hooks**  
- Ultimate test of naval combat skill  
- Can trigger massive world events if unchecked  
- Slaying him may leave the dragon unbound…

## The Archipelago & Your Place in It

### Home Waters
The **inner archipelago**—where you begin—is the last bastion of order. Ports here pay lip service to distant crowns, but in practice they answer to merchants, guilds, and whoever keeps the peace. This is where new captains earn their stripes: trading goods, taking contracts, and building infamy.

### The Outer Seas
Beyond the safe routes, the map grows strange. **Route modifiers** reflect the influence of the Kings:
- **Fog** — Veilwake Sea (Jasper's domain)
- **Serpent marks** — Coiled Expanse (Mordekai)
- **Coral ruins, tidal currents** — Drowned Crown (Adara)
- **Darkness, abyssal waters** — Black Spiral (Nimue)
- **Ash, volcanic vents** — Ashen Reach (Ebon)

### Pirate King Strongholds
Each King maintains **strongholds** in their domain. Defeating a **Lieutenant**—a trusted captain who serves a King—reveals the coordinates of that King's stronghold. Raiding a stronghold is the ultimate challenge: unique loot, legendary encounters, and—for those who dare—**rescued dragons** held in captivity.

### Dragon Sanctuaries
Hidden islands and secret coves serve as **dragon sanctuaries**—places where rescued eggs can hatch and young dragons can grow in peace. Finding, building, and protecting these sanctuaries is central to your mission. Some lie in the Home Waters; others require venturing into the outer seas.

## Tone & Narrative Beats

**Tone:** Adventurous, slightly comedic, readable fantasy piracy—with darker undertones when the Kings are involved.

**Your story:**  
You are a new captain climbing the ranks—and you carry a secret mission: **rescue and save the last of the dragons**. The Five Pirate Kings hunt them relentlessly; you defy them by finding eggs before hunters do, freeing captured dragons from strongholds, and ferrying them to sanctuaries where they can thrive. The Shattered Seas offer profit, danger, and legend—but your true calling is to protect what the Kings would destroy. Defeat lieutenants, uncover stronghold locations, and decide: will you serve a King, defy them, or carve your own path—and save the dragons?
